# Data Challenge Templates

Companies issue data challenges as part of their interview processes, and can usually range from a few hours to a few days. 

I have created templates that include IDA/EDA, statistical analysis (corr/normality), regression, classification, and other areas in machine learning (NLP/Time series). 
I would recommend to budget appropriate amounts of time to narrate the data story via the markdown portions of the notebooks. 
I was told that a good team member should be able to communicate their ideas clearly. 
I was also told that good code will be read many times.

If you find these templates useful, great! Best of luck with your future endeavours!
