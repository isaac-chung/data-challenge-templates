# Insight-Data-Challenge

Hello, we are Apples to Audiences, an organic food grocer. We want to reorganize the layout of our store to maximize sales. to do that, we would like to know if we can cluster types of groceries that are typically purchased together.
We have provided you with 3 datasets.

- items.csv : A mapping which maps the item_id to the item name and price
- users.csv : A list of items purchased by a given user
- users_by_items.csv : A matrix that formats data from dataset 1 into a matrix with users in rows and the number of each item_id purchased in columns

What items do you recommend that we place together? Please return a clearly laid out notebook with explanations on your choices and clearly listed functions. You can use any clustering method you'd like.
